### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to distinguish quantum states.
- 🔭 I want to translate [Ogawa1999](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9906090v1) to Lean.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making the lemma statement compile.
- 🐙 Fork the repl, do some math, make a pull request.
- 👯 Eventually I’m looking to collaborate on making the lemma more general.
- 💬 Ask me about the quantum Stein lemma!
